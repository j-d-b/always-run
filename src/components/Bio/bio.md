I love the simplicity of running.

The variety of settings one can run in and the ease of getting out there are unrivaled by any of the other endurance sports; it's the freest form of human self-propulsion.

**Running shoes** are the only core piece of running gear: the *connection to the ground*.

A shoe influences the experience of the running surface, the feel of the stride, and the tone of the run.

I think it's super fun to try new shoes and experience favorites become *'old friends'* as the miles build.

I like the have my mood inspire the shoes I choose each run, and the shoes influence the tone of that run.
